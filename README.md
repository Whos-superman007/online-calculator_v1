An online calculator with CSS and PHP.  
Everyone can help or try the code.  

**Note:** Keep in mind that I am a beginner so it is not really optimized in a particularly clever way.  

## üöÄ Prerequisites  
To run this project locally, you need the following:  

- [XAMPP Control Panel](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) (or any local PHP server)  

## üõ† Installation & Setup  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install XAMPP  
- Download and install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).  
- Open **XAMPP Control Panel**.  
- Find the row with **Apache** and click **Start** to activate the local server.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Move Project Files  
- Copy the project folder (`online-calculator_v2`) into the `htdocs` directory inside the XAMPP installation folder.  
  - Example path: `C:\xampp\htdocs\online-calculator_v2` (on Windows)  
  - For macOS/Linux, it might be `/Applications/XAMPP/htdocs/online-calculator_v2`  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Project in Your Browser

## üõ† Troubleshooting  
If the project does not open:  
1. Ensure Apache is running in the XAMPP Control Panel.  
2. Check that the project folder is inside `htdocs`.  
3. Try restarting XAMPP and reloading `http://localhost/online-calculator_v2/`.
